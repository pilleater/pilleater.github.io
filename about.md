This is a platform providing information and clarity on various discussions, arguments, debates and interests in a compact, easy to understand fashion. I provide an analysis of politics, economics, philosophy, art criticism, and general topics deemed too taboo for mainstream discussion. 

I am always thinking about new interesting things to talk about. What you will find in my work is a collection of my experiences and thoughts about the state we live in.

I don't create content. This is anti-content, or "dark" data. Download all my articles, pdfs, videos, photos, tweets, and music, and store it on a USB stick, SD Card, or by any means. The point is to secure digital property against the state. 

I am anti-capitalist, anti-liberal, anti-social, and against modernity. 

We must accelerate the revolution.
